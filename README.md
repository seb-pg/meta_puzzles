## meta_puzzles

meta_puzzles are solutions to the Meta/Facebook puzzles available on Meta's careers website at https://www.metacareers.com/profile/coding_puzzles/.

The complete solutions are provided in following languages:
* Python (3): was developed first
* C\++(17): was developed second and the code is written in a "plausible" medium developer style (it just works with basic C++ and no fancy optimisation).

Mostly complete solutions are provided in the following languages (The code is updated regularly)
* C# (compatible with .Net 7.0 and mostly compatible with .Net Code 3.1): based on C\++17
* Rust (1.66): based on C\++17
* Go (1.9.4): based on C\++17, uses generics which are not supported by Meta online tests.

The intent is to use these solutions in a multi-language comparison, with additional languages (solutions being written) such as Swift, Scala, and Kotlin.

The idea is to evaluate which languages would be suitable to write quantitative strategies on a wide scale:  if you are working for a hedge fund (or a bank) and have people writing trading strategies, one might want to use a common language for that purpose.

A possible model is to use an easy language, such as Python, and "productionize" strategies with "real software developer".  Another strategy is to use a language easy to pick up, less likely to create problem (on a wide scale), offers good performances, and overall, provide a good value for money.

This first phase is about comparing basic language ecosystem needs, i.e. just the language with some basic collections.

## Files description


<u>py3/*</u>

The solutions in Python 3, all tested on Meta's website.

The solutions provided are passing all Meta's tests on their website. Meta's basic tests and some additional are also provided in the source code.

Written in my "quick and dirty" Python style.

"sortedcontainers" has been used to provide "binary tree" like containers/collections needed to solve l4_conveyor_chaos and l4_mathematical_art.


<u>cpp17/*</u>

The solutions in C\++17 (complete).

The solutions provided  are passing all Meta's tests on their website. Meta's basic tests and some additional are also provided in the source code.

C\++20 (or C\++23) would have helped making the code shorter and easier to read, but Meta's website is stuck in C\++17.

The code is written using a "plausible" medium developer style, and not much emphasis is spent on optimisation:
* it is intentional that, sometimes, shared_pointer are used when not needed (as it matches the Python's code and provides an additional opportunity for  benchmark).
* explicit int width: Meta seems to live in a meta  world where int is 32 bits, and long long is 64 bits.  int32_t/int64_t are used instead.
* Meta also leaves in a world where it is normal to pass vector or string by value, rather than reference.  This is corrected so functions can be hooked up without overhead when measuring performances.
* l3_rabbit_hole2: iterative and recursive solutions are provided (could be interested for speed benchmark).
* l4_mathematical_art: for GCC, it can use "order_of_key" on std::set to match Python's code as std::distance in STL is linear on std::set, not logarithmic.


<u>cs/*</u>

The solutions in C#, ported from C++ (mostly complete, 2 solutions missing).

The solutions provided are passing all Meta's tests on their website. Meta's basic tests and some additional are also provided in the source code..

Solutions l4_conveyor_chaos and l4_mathematical_art are missing because C# does not provided an(log(n)) equivalent of [C\++] std::lower_bound for [C\++] std::set or std::map equivalents.


<u>go/*</u>

The solutions in Go, "ported" from C++ (mostly complete, 3 solutions are missing).

The solutions provided are passing all Meta's tests on their website (once the generics are removed: they are not supported by Meta's website). Meta's basic tests and some additional are also provided in the source code.

Solutions l2_portals, l4_conveyor_chaos and l4_mathematical_art are missing because an equivalent of [C\++] std::set is needed.


<u>rs/*</u>

The solutions in Rust, "ported" from C++ (mostly complete, 3 solutions are missing).

The solutions provided are passing all Meta's tests on their website. Meta's basic tests and some additional are also provided in the source code..

Solutions l4_conveyor_chaos and l4_mathematical_art are missing because it is not (yet) obvious if Rust is providing a (log(n)) equivalent of [C\++] std::lower_bound for std::set, where it is necessary (because of speed requirement) for l4_conveyor_chaos and l4_mathematical_art.

## Notes

The solutions are  provided "as is". While the author is happy to provide reasonable
assistance, there is no guarantee any assistance will be provided.
